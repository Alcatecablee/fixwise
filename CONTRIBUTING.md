# Contributing to NeuroLint

Thank you for your interest in contributing to NeuroLint! 

NeuroLint is a deterministic, rule-based code transformation engine for TypeScript, JavaScript, React, and Next.js projects. We welcome contributions of all kinds: bug fixes, new transformation rules, documentation improvements, and feature enhancements.

---

## 📌 Overview

NeuroLint uses a **7-Layer Architecture** to progressively fix and optimize code:

1. **Configuration Layer** – tsconfig.json, package.json, next.config.js fixes
2. **Pattern Layer** – unused imports, console.log cleanup, HTML entities
3. **Component Layer** – React keys, accessibility, props
4. **Hydration Layer** – SSR guards for window, document, and localStorage
5. **Next.js Layer** – App Router improvements, "use client" handling
6. **Testing Layer** – error boundaries, test scaffolding
7. **Adaptive Layer** – custom rule learning and pattern recognition

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Neurolint.git
cd Neurolint
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run Tests

```bash
# Run the full test suite
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

All tests should pass before submitting a PR.

## 🧪 How NeuroLint Works

NeuroLint uses **AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) parsing** with Babel to:
1. Parse code into an AST
2. Apply deterministic transformation rules
3. Generate clean, fixed code
4. Validate transformations before applying

**Key principle:** All transformations are **rule-based** and **deterministic** – no AI, no LLMs, no unpredictable behavior.

## Types of Contributions

### 1. Bug Fixes

Found a bug? Great!

1. **Open an issue** describing the bug with:
   - Code sample that triggers the bug
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - NeuroLint version (`neurolint --version`)

2. **Submit a PR** with:
   - Fix for the bug
   - Test case that covers the bug
   - Clear explanation of what was broken

### 2. New Transformation Rules

Want to add a new rule?

1. **Identify the layer** it belongs to (1-7)
2. **Add the rule** to the appropriate `scripts/fix-layer-X.js` file
3. **Write tests** in `__tests__/` to verify the rule works
4. **Update documentation** if needed

**Example rule structure:**
```javascript
// In scripts/fix-layer-3-components.js
function fixMissingKeys(ast) {
  traverse(ast, {
    JSXElement(path) {
      // Your transformation logic here
    }
  });
}
```

### 3. Documentation Improvements

Documentation is always welcome:
- Fix typos or unclear explanations
- Add examples
- Improve README or CLI_USAGE.md
- Add comments to complex code

### 4. Test Coverage

Help us reach 100% test coverage:
- Add tests for untested edge cases
- Improve existing test clarity
- Add integration tests
