you dont know the whole story and this is not the actual repo with the published cli, i just copied the cli.js and scripts folder and few other script and started new repo as fixwise but its not. Im just trying to fix the reason why there is no users, why are you not testing to find out exact whats not working on cli, and you only focusing on the homepage not cli.

story below: read and understand eac layer, The layer system is designed to be progressive and safe. Each layer builds upon the previous ones, ensuring that foundational issues are resolved before applying more complex transformations. You can run individual layers or multiple layers together based on your specific needs.


I was vibe-coding on my side project Taxfy.co.za when I suddenly started getting a flood of ESLint errors, hydration bugs, and missing React keys, over 700 issues total. Out of frastration, I told Cursor to “think outside the box!” and... it actually did. No commentary, no LLM small talk, it just created two files: fix-layer-1-config.js and fix-layer-2-patterns.js, ran both, and then checked to see if the errors had dropped.

We were stunned from 600+ issues down to just 70. Cursor itself was shocked. So we kept going.

Each time a new class of bugs showed up, Cursor responded with a new intelligent fix layer. Eventually, I had this:

Layer 1: Config validation (tsconfig, next.config.js)

Layer 2: Pattern fixes (HTML entities, unused imports)

Layer 3: React best practices (keys, accessibility)

Layer 4: SSR/hydration guards

Layer 5: Next.js App Router optimizations

Layer 6: Quality improvements (error boundaries, React.memo)

And the orchestrator that brings it all together: fix-master.js.


I moved those files to their own folder... and just like that, NeuroLint.dev was born.

NeuroLint is an advanced, rule-based code analysis and transformation platform that automatically fixes bugs, improves performance, and enforces best practices no unpredictable AI, just precise, layered code intelligence.

It’s built for TypeScript, JavaScript, React, and Next.js. Powered by AST parsing, pattern recognition, and deterministic rule-based fixes.
